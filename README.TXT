A digital river is a sequence of numbers where the number following n is n plus the sum of its digits. For example, 12345 is followed by 12360, since 1+2+3+4+5 = 15. If the first number of a digital river is k we will call it river k.

For example, river 480 is the sequence beginning {480, 492, 507, 519, ...} and river 483 is the sequence beginning {483, 498, 519, ...}.

Normal streams and rivers can meet, and the same is true for digital rivers. This happens when two digital rivers share some of the same values. For example: river 480 meets river 483 at 519, meets river 507 at 507, and never meets river 481.

Every digital river will eventually meet river 1, river 3 or river 9.
